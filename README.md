Predicting the successful landing of SpaceX Falcon 9 Rockets

The commercialized space travel has become a possibility with recent developments from companies such as SpaceX and Virgin Galactic. Although still not commonly accessible due to its costs, recent technological developments, particularly with reusable booster rockets, have significantly reduced the cost of launching into space. For SpaceX, the recovery and reuse of the first stage rockets directly affects the cost of each launch. Therefore, accurately predicting the whether SpaceX will reuse their rockets can provide important applications for estimating business operation costs.

SpaceX launch data was obtained by access of SpaceX REST API and from web scrapped of relevant Wikipedia tables of SpaceX launches. This includes numerous launch parameters, along with the outcome variable of whether the rockets were reused.
